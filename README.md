# Schelling_Model

This project was developed to have a first approach to sociology-related simulations, in the subject _Computational Modeling of Complex Systems_ in Adam Mickiewicz University.

**Note:** The ratio of empty cells don't work as it should, so I improvised a temporary solution. This may be changed in the future but, for now, the number of empty cells is given as the difference between the total number of cells and the ratio of cells of each populatiom (Total_cells * (1 - pop1_ratio - pop2_ratio - pop3_ratio))
